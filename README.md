# WeekCalendarView
Problem - to do horizontal scroll by weeks (month at the top, day of month at the middle and day of week at the bottom).
Goals:
      1.To do it responsive for changing width and hight.
      2.To do ability to set start and end date.
      3.To do readable code with less bugs, deprications and redurant things

Why I do that:
              I suggested to create this solution of week view.
              I saw not many solutions of this problem in git and internet.
              Will very appriciate for help in this project cause I want to do it work with no bugs.

All code opensource - every one can use it, remake and contribute!
